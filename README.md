Then, just add this somewhere on you `<body>`:

## Configuration

On a initializer you can configure some things (defaults are shown here):

```ruby
# false to remove the default internal link, a string to link an external page
EuCookies.display_policy = true
# true to treat page scroll as acceptance
EuCookies.use_scroll = false
# false to disable all the features
EuCookies.enabled = true
```

## Styling

To quickly customize position and styles you can override some Sass variables,
take a look to your `app/assets/stylesheets/eu_cookies.scss` file.

French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish.
